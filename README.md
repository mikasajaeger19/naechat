# Naechat

Naechat is a simple chat application that allows people to communicate with each other and create groups for group conversations. It is designed to be easy to use and does not rely on external APIs, making it self-contained and suitable for local or private deployments.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and securely authenticate themselves to access the chat application.
  
- **Group Creation:** Users can create groups for group conversations. Each group has a name and can have multiple members.

- **Group Chats:** Users can participate in group chats within the groups they are members of. They can send messages, view message history, and interact with other members in real-time.

- **Direct Messaging:** Users can send direct messages to each other for private conversations outside of group chats.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** The frontend of Naechat is built using React. It utilizes modern web technologies and frameworks for a responsive and intuitive user interface.

- **Backend:** The backend of Naechat is powered by a server-side technology stack (e.g., Node.js, Express.js) and Prisma for storing user data, groups, messages, and other application data.
